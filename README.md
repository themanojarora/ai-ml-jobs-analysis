## üìÅ Project Structure

This repository is organized into multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a specific phase of the data science pipeline:

| Notebook File | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `AI_Job_Market_01_Data_Loading_Preparation.ipynb` | Loads and explores the raw dataset for structure and initial insights. |
| `AI_Job_Market_02_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` | Performs visual EDA on salaries, experience levels, skills, and more. |
| `AI_Job_Market_03_Data_Cleaning_Feature_Engineering.ipynb` | Cleans the data and creates new features like `job_posting_duration` and `remote_friendly`. |
| `AI_Job_Market_04_Geographic_Visualizations.ipynb` | Analyzes trends and distributions across countries. |
| `AI_Job_Market_05_Salary_Prediction_Modeling.ipynb` | Builds a regression model to predict salaries from job and company features. |
| `AI_Job_Market_06_Skill_Demand_Analysis.ipynb` | Identifies the most in-demand skills and their frequency. |
| `AI_Job_Market_07_Company_Insights_and_Benefits.ipynb` | Analyzes company size, benefits scores, and employment types. |
| `AI_Job_Market_08_Time_Series_and_Trend_Analysis.ipynb` | Analyzes job posting trends over time. |
| `AI_Job_Market_09_Salary_Prediction_With_Testing.ipynb` | Adds evaluation (R¬≤, MSE), comparison of predicted vs actual salaries, and feature importance. |
| `AI_Job_Market_10_End_to_End_Salary_Pipeline.ipynb` | Implements a complete ML pipeline using `ColumnTransformer`, `Pipeline`, and optional `GridSearchCV`. |
